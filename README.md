# jsRocket

This is a fun and a proof of concept app, that allows piloting a space ship in a simulated nearby earth area.
It was developed while the author was learning basics of JavaScript and JQuery.

The red space ship can be controlled by the user with arrow keys. 
Please note that the planet gravity can affect the space ship movements.
